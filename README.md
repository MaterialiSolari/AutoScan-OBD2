# AutoScan-OBD2
This project uses an Arduino and CAN-BUS Shield to interact with a vehicle’s ECU via the OBD-II protocol. It retrieves data like RPM, speed, and fuel level, processes it, and can clear Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs). It’s useful for vehicle diagnostics, performance monitoring, and troubleshooting.
